## Business Overview
### Introduction
We have arrived at a point in time where, a large percentage of the population has access to the internet. Through that, there are many social media platforms where people can share their opinions on various things, making them an invaluable resource for companies looking to harness this to optimise business practices.

### Business Understanding
As stated above, Twitter is an invaluable resource for companies for gathering data on public sentiment. Apple and Google are two such companies that stand to benefit from this. They are constantly and consistently designing and rolling out new products and services, and public feedback is crucial to the optimization of products and rollout.

### Business Problem
The foremost issue we need to address the need for a system to more clearly and accurately group the data in away that can inform future company decisions. A natural language processing model is needed to classify tweets by whether they are positive, negative or neutral.

### Metrics of Success
- *Accuracy.*:  Measure the frequency with which the sentiment classification model correctly separates tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

- *Precision, Recall, and F1 Score*: These metrics measure the model's ability to balance precision(correctly classification) and recall (identifying all positive/negative sentiments).

### Data Understanding
The data was acquired from this site. Contributors evaluated tweets about multiple brands and products. The crowd was asked if the tweet expressed positive, negative, or no emotion towards a brand and/or product. If some emotion was expressed they were also asked to say which brand or product was the target of that emotion.

### Modelling and Evaluation
We chose to use a few models for classification, which included:
 - Logistic Regression.

### Summary
The goal was to build a machine learning model capable of classifying the sentiment of tweets related to various tech products. After analyzing and processing a dataset of tweets, we implemented and evaluated several machine learning models, focusing on improving the modelâ€™s ability to classify positive and negative sentiments effectively.

### Conclusion
 - The majority of tweets related to tech products exhibited positive sentiments, reflecting strong brand perceptions for the products analyzed.
 - The Random Forest classifier emerged as the best-performing model with balanced precision and recall, making it well-suited for real-world application in sentiment classification.
 - Although the model performed well, the class imbalance (more neutral and positive tweets) suggests the need for careful data handling to maintain performance across all classes, particularly for the minority negative class.

### Recommendations
 - Given that positive sentiment dominates the data, brands can leverage this in marketing campaigns by highlighting the most favorable topics (e.g., product innovation, customer satisfaction).
 - Negative sentiment still exists and revolves around specific issues. Addressing common negative themes like battery performance for Apple or map service issues for Google can help improve overall perception.
 - Expand the analysis to other product categories or competitor products to gain broader insights into customer sentiment across the tech industry.

### Next Steps
- Gather additional tweet data to balance the class distribution, especially for the underrepresented negative sentiment class, which can improve model training and reduce bias toward neutral/positive tweets.
- Deploy the fine-tuned Random Forest model in production for real-time monitoring of social media sentiment, allowing companies to respond swiftly to customer feedback and emerging trends.
